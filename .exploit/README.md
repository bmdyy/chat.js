# Exploits

## Blind NoSQL Injection (Auth Bypass)
The `username` parameter in `POST /register` is subject to blind NoSQL injection. We can leverage this to dump the SHA-256 password hashes of any user in the database.

- PoC: `dumpPasswordHash.py`
- Usage: `python3 dumpPasswordHash.py ip:3000 user`

The passwords used in this app are weak on purpose, any the hashes can be looked up using a site such as https://crackstation.net/

## Deserialization (RCE)
The draft feature uses a vulnerable node package (`node-serialize`), which is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

- PoC: `...`
- Usage: `...`
